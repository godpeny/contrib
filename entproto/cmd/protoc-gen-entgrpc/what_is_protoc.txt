<intro>
protoc (aka the Protocol Compiler) can be extended via plugins.
A plugin is just a program that reads a CodeGeneratorRequest from stdin and writes a CodeGeneratorResponse to stdout.
A plugin executable needs only to be placed somewhere in the path.
The plugin should be named “protoc-gen-$NAME”, and will then be used when the flag “–${NAME}_out” is passed to protoc.

<protoc-option>
Users can pass each protoc plugin some custom options using the --<plugin>_opt flag.

<protogen>
The great news is that when they released the v2 API for Protobuf,
the Go team included a wonderful little library named protogen that makes it super-easy to write protoc plugins.
